MBC1-Verilog
============

This is a simple implemtion of MBC1 on FPGA. But current code is not designed to make FPGA to be a drop in replacement of MBC1, though it can be easily achieved.

## Usage

Use this code on any FPGA board with NOR flash/EEPROM and SRAM(if needed). Flash the ROM into ROM, connect all signals labeled GB to gameboy cartridge connector, power the FPGA then GB, done.
